            <p class="card-text"> Although I have taken
                PLTW Robotics in eighth grade, Computer Science Principles is my 
                first and last engineering class that I have taken throughout my 
                high school career. After learning the basics of applications 
                such as Photoshop and Autodesk Maya, I became more intrigued by 
                computers and other electronics, influencing me to take the 
                Computer Science Principles course offered at Dublin High
                School. I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge and 
                comprehension of Computer Science in college. </p>
              <p class="card-text"> In addition to my interest in Computer 
                Science, I also am fascinated by the artistic world.  
                Every single year in high school, I have enrolled in a visual arts
                class, ranging from the typical
                traditional art to three-dimensional modelling. My volunteer 
                experience at the Children's Creativity Museum in San Francisco 
                allowed me to share these passions by teaching children and adults
                the fundamentals of stop-motion animation and basic coding. 
                Art has always been my creative 
                outlet, and I hope Computer Science will be one as well.</p>
               <p class="card-text"> As the former secretary of the 
                Stress Free Club in Dublin High School, I realized that 
                responsibility was crucial to the fulfillment of the role. 
                My duties within the club include sending notifications through 
                email and Remind for meetings, 
                responding to questions asked by members, preparing activities, 
                and recording the duration, number of participants, and activities  
                of meetings.</p>

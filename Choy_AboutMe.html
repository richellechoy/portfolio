              <p class="card-text"> Although I have taken
              PLTW Robotics in eighth grade, Computer Science Principles is my 
              first and last engineering class that I have taken throughout my 
              high school career. After learning the basics of applications 
              such as Photoshop and Autodesk Maya, I became more intrigued by 
              computers and other electronics, influencing me to take the 
              Computer Science Principles course offered at Dublin High
              School. I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge and 
              comprehension of Computer Science in college. </p>
              <p class="card-text"> In addition to my interest in Computer 
              Science, I also am fascinated by the artistic world.  
              Every single year in high school, I have enrolled in a visual arts
              class, ranging from the typical
              traditional art to three-dimensional modelling. My volunteer 
              experience at the Children's Creativity Museum in San Francisco 
              allowed me to share these passions by teaching children and adults
              the fundamentals of stop-motion animation and basic coding. 
              Art has always been my creative 
              outlet, and I hope Computer Science will be one as well.</p>
              <p class="card-text"> As the former secretary of the (inactive) 
              Stress Free Club in Dublin High School, I realized that 
              responsibility was crucial to the fulfillment of the role. 
              My duties within the club include sending notifications through 
              email and Remind for meetings, 
              responding to questions asked by members, preparing activities, 
              and recording the duration, number of participants, and activities  
              of meetings.</p>
              <p class="card-text">Thank you for you time. Please consider 
              visiting
              the other sections of my website at your own discretion. Also, 
              please ignore my picture. I know it's not professional, but I had  
              to put something there.</p>

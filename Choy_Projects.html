          <h5>Project: Scratch Triathlon Game</h5>
          <h5>Course: Computer Science Principles</h5>
          <h5>Duration: 8/30/18 - 9/6/18</h5>
          <h5>Objective: To Create An Interactive Game</h5>
          <h5>Type of Project: Collaborative</h5>
          <p>The objective of this project was to design an interactive game that 
            consisted of levels with varying difficulty that made players feel a sense of 
            progression. My partner and I collectively agreed that it was appropriate to 
            design the game based off a triathlon, in which three levels are dedicated to 
            running, biking, and swimming respectively. As the player progresses 
            further into the game, they will encounter more obstacles that will prevent
            them from reaching the finish line. In order to be qualified to pass the
            finish line, the player must collect three stars that are scattered
            throughout the game. Because this game restarts from the beginning when
            the player comes into contact with an obstacle, it encourages players
            to apply their experiences from their mistakes to progress further in the 
            game, thus developing their skill. My role during the creation process of this 
            game alternated betweeen being a leader and a follower. Sometimes I would
            be the individual would be making suggestions, and other
            times I would be the individual that is directly altering
            and improving the code. 
            Despite the successes that we experienced, we also
            encountered issues that hindered our process. Initially,
            we decided to implement a jumping system,
            similar to many popular platforming games. However, the
            jumping movement was not as smooth as expected, thus
            negatively impacting the player's sense of fun. In order
            to replace the jumping system, we decided to have players
            avoid obstacles by using the arrow keys.

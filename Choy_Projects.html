          <h5>Project: Scratch Triathlon Game</h5>
          <h5>Course: Computer Science Principles</h5>
          <h5>Duration: 8/30/18 - 9/6/18</h5>
          <h5>Objective: To Create An Interactive Game</h5>
          <h5>Type of Project: Collaborative</h5>
          <p>The objective of this project was to design an interactive game 
            that 
            consisted of levels with varying difficulty that made players feel 
            a sense of 
            progression. My partner and I collectively agreed that it was 
            appropriate to 
            design the game based off a triathlon, in which three levels are 
            dedicated to 
            running, biking, and swimming respectively.
            </p>
            <p>As the player progresses 
            further into the game, they will encounter more obstacles that will
            prevent
            them from reaching the finish line. In order to be qualified to pass
            the
            finish line, the player must collect three stars that are scattered
            throughout the game. Since this game restarts from the beginning 
            when
            the player comes into contact with an obstacle, it encourages 
            players
            to apply their experiences from their mistakes to progress further 
            in the 
            game, thus developing their skill.
            </p>
            <p>My role during the creation 
            process of this 
            game alternated betweeen being a leader and a follower. Sometimes 
            I would
            be the individual making suggestions, and other
            times I would be the individual that is directly altering
            and improving the code. 
            Despite the successes that we experienced, we also
            encountered issues that hindered our process. Initially,
            we decided to implement a jumping system,
            similar to many popular platforming games. However, the
            jumping movement was not as smooth as expected, thus
            negatively impacting the player's sense of fun. In order
            to replace the jumping system, we decided to have players
            avoid obstacles by using the arrow keys.

            <h5>Project: Image Manipulation</h5>
            <h5>Course: Computer Science Principles</h5>
            <h5>Duration: 2/25/19-</h5>
            <h5>Objective: To Create a Program To Manipulate Images for a Client</h5>
            <h5>Type of Project: Collaborative</h5>
            <p> The objective of this project was to design a program that will
            satisfy the image manipulation requirements for a client, which
            was the World Wildlife Fund. We were tasked to incorporate a
            consistent logo, a geometric shaped border, abstract act, and a
            range of options to cusotmize their image. 
            </p>
            <p>In order to operate 
            the program, an individual must upload an image (must be .jpg) 
            to the 1.4.7 folder. Then, type in %run 1.4.7/Final.py in the code 
            editor and press enter. Next, type in modify('whatever') and replace
            'whatever' with 'nice', 'warm', 'cool', 'neutral', 
            'logo_and_border_1', or 'logo_and_border_2'. The first four options
            perform pixel manipulation while the last two adds a logo and border
            onto the desired image. Three equivalent colored stripes with a
            black silhouette of the image will be produced as a result. 
            </p>
            <p>My role
            in this particular project was primarily to code. It was crucial to 
            communicate errors and ideas to my partner, which we worked to
            implement and fix together. While experimenting with image fr
            manipulation, we encountered an issue. When specifying ranges
            for the colored stripes, we realized that it would only apply for 
            image with 2000x3000 pixels. However, we resolved this issue by
            establishing two different variables that we can implement into our
            code multiples times and divide them by three in order to 
            create three equivalent stripes on images, regardless of pixel size.
